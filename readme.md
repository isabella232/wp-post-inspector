## Post Inspector WordPress Plugin ##

Adds a simple metabox to each post/page displaying its meta information, even works on Custom Post Types!  Displays the Post object,

The Post Inspector metabox displays in the Edit Post (or Page) screen in your WP Admin.  It displays information about the post that is useful for debugging.
